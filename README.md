This project involved the creation of an AI generative ChatBot, designed to function as a resume assistant. The ChatBot, powered by botpress, answers queries about my work experience.

Problem:
The challenge was to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that could provide detailed information about my professional background in a more engaging and accessible manner than a traditional resume.

My Contributions:
Utilizing my skills in Prototyping, Wireframing, UX Design, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning, I developed this AI ChatBot. I designed the user interface, trained the AI model, and tested it to ensure functionality and user-friendliness.

Outcomes:
The resulting AI ChatBot serves as an innovative and interactive resume assistant, providing a unique and engaging way for potential clients or employers to learn about my work experience. It showcases not only my past work but also my skills in AI and UX design.
